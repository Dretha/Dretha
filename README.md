He/his
I love programming in Java, developing mods for minecraft and android applications. I learned to program in java myself by reading articles on the Internet, reading books, taking courses on Udemy and Javarush. I have been programming for 1 year now. My biggest project - Oshiete Mod I have been developing for 5 months, the number of lines of code in it is more than 20000. Now it is in the pre-release stage of development. You can evaluate my skills by following the link I left to my public GitHub profile. I have also developed several small Android apps and dozens of tiny educational projects.

I know not so many technologies and frameworks, but I am always ready to learn everything new. I would like to know what skills are required on your project in order to learn it. I am ready to take any courses that you offer to take.

I know Russian well, so far I can only communicate in English through Google translator :) my English training is ongoing, at the moment I know a lot of words and write correctly.

I am a very sociable and kind person, I never judge other people for their features or preferences. I think that I will feel good in any team.

I prefer to develop games and business applications, but I am ready to work on any project in Java.

At the moment I am in Georgia in the city of Batumi, so if your office is not located there, I can work with you remotely. I am ready to work at any time, as long as you need. My salary expectations start at $700 per month.

In my free time, I print on a 3D printer, develop 3D models for printing, assemble and solder devices from Chinese components, draw with a pencil and watercolor, play the ocarina. I studied at the medical university for 3 years, but left it because I realized that it was not for me. I love games, anime, star wars and memes. I moved to Georgia from Russia because I don't want to sponsor the invasion of Ukraine with my taxes.
